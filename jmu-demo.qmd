For this application exercise, we will work with data on fish. The dataset we will use, called `fish`, is on two common fish species in fish market sales.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages-data
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

fish <- read_csv("data/fish.csv")
```

The data dictionary is below:

  | **variable**      | **description**        |
  |-------------------|------------------------|
  | `species`         | Species name of fish   |
  | `weight`          | Weight, in grams       |
  | `length_vertical` | Vertical length, in cm |
  | `length_diagonal` | Diagonal length, in cm |
  | `length_cross`    | Cross length, in cm    |
  | `height`          | Height, in cm          |
  | `width`           | Diagonal width, in cm  |
  

# Visualizing the model

We're going to investigate the relationship between the weights and heights of fish. Specifically, we are interested in if height explains the changes in fish weight.

Our explanatory variable is *Add response here* 

Our response variable is *Add response here*

-   **Demo:** Create an appropriate plot to investigate this relationship. Add appropriate labels to the plot.

```{r}
#| label: plot-hw
#| eval: false

fish |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = ... , y = ...)
  ) + 
  geom_point() +
  #insert code for labels here

```
  

# Fitting your line 

Add the line to your plot above using `geom_smooth()`. Is this a linear model? Why or why not? If not, let's fix it!

*Add response here*



# How do we use this line? 

-   What types of questions can this plot help answer?

*Add response here.*

# Model Prediction

-   **Demo:** Fit a model to predict fish weights from their heights.

```{r}
#| label: fit-model
#| eval: false

fish_model <- linear_reg() |>
  set_engine("...") |>
  fit(... ~ ... , data = fish)

fish_model

```

-   **Your turn (3 minutes):** Predict what the weight of a fish would be with a height of 10 cm, 15 cm, and 40 cm using this model.

```{r}
#| label: predict-by-hand

# insert code here

```

Which prediction is considered extrapolation? Why?

*Add Response Here*

Why is extrapolation important to consider when making predictions?

# Model summary

-   **Demo:** Display the model summary including estimates for the slope and intercept along with measurements of uncertainty around them. Show how you can extract these values from the model output.

```{r}
#| label: model-summary

fish_model |>
  tidy() 
```

-   **Demo:** Write out your model using mathematical notation.

Hint: You can type equations within dollar signs. LaTeX equations are authored using standard Pandoc markdown syntax (the editor will automatically recognize the syntax and treat the equation as math in the code chunks). It will appear as rendered math in your document.

Example:

$\hat{x^n} + \beta^n = z_n + \epsilon_i$


$add-response$ 

# Interpretations 

Interpret the slope coefficient in the context of the problem

*Add response* 

Interpret the intercept in the context of the problem

*Add response*

# Why this line and not another?

Let's brainstorm how R picked this line over another line? Why is this line the "best fit line"?

      
*Add response here.*


## Residual

What is a residual?

*Add response here*

What do residuals look like?

Calculate predicted weights for all fish in the data and visualize the residuals under this model. Hint: We are going to use the `augment` function in R to get the information we need.

```{r}
#| label: resid 

fish_hw_aug <- augment(fish_model$fit)

fish_hw_aug |>
ggplot(
 aes(x = height, y = weight)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "lightgrey") +  
  geom_segment(aes(xend = height, yend = .fitted), color = "gray") +  
  geom_point(aes(y = .fitted), shape = "circle open") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Weights vs. heights of fish",
    subtitle = "Residuals",
    x = "Height (cm)",
    y = "Weight (gr)"
  )
```
