  For this application exercise, we will work with data on fish. The dataset we will use, called `fish`, is on two common fish species in fish market sales.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages-data
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

fish <- read_csv("data/fish.csv")
```

The data dictionary is below:

  | **variable**      | **description**        |
  |-------------------|------------------------|
  | `species`         | Species name of fish   |
  | `weight`          | Weight, in grams       |
  | `length_vertical` | Vertical length, in cm |
  | `length_diagonal` | Diagonal length, in cm |
  | `length_cross`    | Cross length, in cm    |
  | `height`          | Height, in cm          |
